## üìå Overview

**LINE on Vivaldi** is an **unofficial helper script** that sets up the **official LINE Web extension** (available from LINE Corporation) to work in Chromium-based browsers ‚Äî specifically [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) ‚Äî and presents it in a way that mimics the look and feel of the LINE desktop app for Windows.

This project does **not** modify or repackage the LINE extension. It simply installs the extension in a compatible way and adds a launcher to integrate it into the Linux desktop experience.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by LINE Corporation.**  
It uses publicly available and unmodified components to enhance user convenience on Linux.

**Note:** If LINE Corporation ever releases an official Linux version of the LINE desktop app, this helper project will be removed immediately.
